In this era, we know that the primary building block of any communication is speech, so 
there is no communication establishment without saying anything. So we see the importance of 
conveying the correct information to the right person; without that, there is no meaning in 
communication. In today's world, everything is going digital, like a smartphone, text messages, and 
many different websites, so accessing these things can be a significant issue for dumb or illiterate 
people. They don't know how to read something written on the screen. One more issue is someone 
who cannot understand the language of synthesized speech generated by the system due to the accent 
problem, and they can now listen to the written text in their own accent and their own voice. So from 
here, the motivation for my research came. Since many tools are developed using this idea, I aim to 
build a tool in python language for generating speech for the written text in the User's voice. For this 
purpose, I have used Audacity software to record the phoneme sound and save it to the directory in 
wave format (*.wav). After that, these phonemes are concatenated to form a meaningful word. Since 
it is a domain-specific prototype model, it doesn't require a lot of memory to store phoneme sounds 
because some specific terms are chosen from a particular domain developing the tool.
